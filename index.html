            <p>
                When I compare<br>
                What I have lost with what I have gained,<br>
                What I have missed with what attained,<br>
                Little room do I find for pride.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I am aware<br>
                How many days have been idly spent;<br>
                How like an arrow the good intent<br>
                Has fallen short or been turned aside.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                But who shall dare<br>
                To measure loss and gain in this wise?<br>
                Defeat may be victory in disguise;<br>
                The lowest ebb is the turn of the tide.<br>
            </p>
